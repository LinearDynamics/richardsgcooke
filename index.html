        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm a software developer, Dad, Husband, Son, Neighbor, Musician, Joker from Ottawa. I'm passionate about coding and technology but music is probably my greatest passion.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning technologies. Especially in software but I am conversant in other areas like EE or whatever.</li>
            <li>Writing music</li>
            <li>Building and fixing things!</li>
            <li class="listindent">Why buy when you can build?! I keep our washers and furnaces all in good repair.</li>
            <li class="listindent">I've built entire bikes, speakers, a few electric guitars, shelves, odds and ends.</li>            
            <li>My list of interests is varied and long. Life is just too short!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Charactarized as being both quite jovial and a little bit asocial. Love to see ya, but my social battery depletes pretty quickly(especially in the morning!). <i class="material-icons">local_cafe</i><i class="material-icons">local_cafe</i><i class="material-icons">local_cafe</i></p>
        <p>I can rapidly develop a rappor with just about anyone and aptly converse on many technological topics.</p>

        <h2>Here are some of my recent musical sketches that I created.</h2>
        <p>All my recorded music is only in a sketch state right now. What that means is that they are improvisations that I needed to record because I would like to complete these ideas into full songs at a latter date.</p>
        <p>Rhythm is off, drums are bad, the ideas are cool though!</p>

        <h2>I built a pair of Paul Carmody's 'Hitmakers'</h2>
        <p>These are a set of nearfield studio monitors. 'Nearfield' means that they are intended to be very close to the listener(Ideally pointed towards their ears in a equilateral triangle formation). 'Monitors' usually means that the speakers respond equally across all frequencies. We call them 'flat'. I'll paint them someday.</p>
        <p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/bookshelf-speakers/hitmakers" target="_blank" class="highlight-link"><i class="material-icons">link</i>PC's page on these.</a></p>
        <p>Mine LOOK terrible! But they sound like I expected. Had some issues with the table saw I inherited from my dad. Could not cut a square with that thing no matter what I did.</p> 
        <p>I do a little bit extra to make these sound 'good'. Everything is routed into my computer and into my favorite DAW Reaper. </p>
        <p>I mounted them to computer monitor telescopic arms. This lets me position them with greater ease. Also possibly isolates them from any vibrations that could leak into the desk and cause frequency resonances that could cause issues in tuning.</p>
        <p>Below are some screenshots that show how I EQ them so that they have a 'good' sound. It turns out that quality of sound is a subjective thing and is hotly debated. I have considered using tube amp simulators to add an extra bit of harmonic distortion so that I can emulate a classic hifi amp.</p>
        <p>So there is another image down there of a full frequency 12/6/1 fEARful Greenboy instrument speaker that I also made. However at 48Hz-70Hz, there is a steep rolloff as a crossover so I can use it as a sub.</p>
        <p>I haven't measured the room or my responses but this is a pretty nice set up.</p>
        <p>Aiyama A07 class D amp with a 48V PSU. Seems just fine!</p>

            <h2>Guitars, Reaper DAW, VSTs, and not having guitar pedals and stuff anymore!</h2>
            <p>So I gave up using pedals and amps. Digital is great fun.</p>
            <p>I don't only use bias fx. There are so many awesome plugins out there. Instrument ones too. Did you know that you can use the output of the ReaTune plugin to control midi instruments?! Nothing but fun there.</p>

        <p>It's all pretty Microsoft-ey. .NET 4.7 desktop/server stuff. Got into .net 5(core), 6, etc a few years ago. Microsoft was trying to unify their .net so that it is usable by all. Made a Blazor WASM dashboard recently which I really loved. Blazor is all basically C# and HTML/CSS. Performing loops and stuff is excellent and easy.</p>
        <p>Been working on an Angular/TS app as well(c# dotnet core back end). Postgress DB. Various hosting.</p>
        <p>I don't love vscode. Regular VS is better. Fight me.</p>
        <p>My first computer was a Tandy CoCo3(Like a Commodore 64). I super miss it.</p>

    <h2>Here is my take on a 1x gravel bike.</h2>
    <p>So it is a 29er carbon fiber MTB frame/Forks</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1x Sensah SRX Pro w/ 11sp dropbar shifter</li>
        <li>Cassette is an 11-52. That means the biggest sprocket on the rear has a lot of teeth. IOW: potential large gear ratio.</li>
        <li>Chainring is a 52T(currently). So yeah, I could have a 1:1 ratio but you would be surprised at how steep it has to get for that to be useful!</li>
        <li>Favero Assioma DUO-Shi(not because I am an athlete, it's because I am a nerd lol!)</li>
        <li>Challenge, Strada Bianca TLR, Tire, 700x40C. In tan as one does.</li>
        <li class="listindent">Holy heck these were hard to mount.</li>
        <li>Crappy whatever rims/brakes</li>
        <li>A nice saddle from aliexpress</li>
        <li>BT speaker is almost as essential as water!!!</li>
        <li>Some of the cabling is internally router. It was annoying to do on this bike as some of the mount points were pinching the cable housing and affecting shifting. <i class="material-icons">mood_bad</i></li>

    <h2>On Humanity</h2>
    <p>I have many thoughts but generally I believe that we should carry more facts with us than opinions(but I DO love to hear others' conclusions.).</p>
    <p>I personally try to keep my ears and mind open. I'm no genius. I genuinely want to know what people think. I'm often wrong. But that just means I'm learning!</p>
    <p>We should also aim to spend as much time with nature as possible. Hug your family. Pick up your guitar or fishing rod or whavever.</p>
    <p>I enjoy the consideration of personhood and self.</p>
